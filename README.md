Automatic mapping of compiled circuits to low-noise sub-graphs

## Overview

One of the main painpoints in executing circuits on IBM Quantum hardware is finding the best qubit mapping.  For a given circuit, one typically tries to pick the best `initial_layout` for a given target system, and then SWAP maps using that set of qubits as the starting point.  However there are a couple of issues with that execution model.  First, an `initial_layout` selected, for example with respect to the noise characteristics of the system, need not be optimal for the SWAP mapping.  In practice this leads to either low-noise layouts with extra SWAP gates inserted in the circuit, or optimally SWAP mapped circuits on (possibly) lousy qubits.  Second, there is no way to know if the system you targeted in the compilation is actually the best one to execute the compiled circuit on.  With 20+ quantum systems, it is hard to determine which device is actually ideal for a given problem.

`mapomatic` tries to tackle these issues in a different way. `mapomatic` is a post-compilation routine that finds the best low noise sub-graph on which to run a circuit given one or more quantum systems as target devices.  Once compiled, a circuit has been rewritten so that its two-qubit gate structure matches that of a given sub-graph on the target system.  `mapomatic` then searches for matching sub-graphs using the VF2 mapper in [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra) ([retworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx) actually), and uses a heuristic to rank them based on error rates determined by the current calibration data. That is to say that given a single target system, `mapomatic` will return the best set of qubits on which to execute the compiled circuit.  Or, given a list of systems, it will find the best system and set of qubits on which to run your circuit.  Given the current size of quantum hardware, and the excellent performance of the VF2 mapper, this whole process is actually very fast.

## Usage

To begin we first import what we need and load our IBM Quantum account.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import *
import mapomatic as mm

IBMQ.load_account()
```

Second we will select a `provider` that has one or more systems of interest in it:

```python

provider = IBMQ.get_provider(group='deployed')
```

We then go through the usual step of making a circuit and calling `transpile` on a given `backend`:

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(5)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0,1)
qc.cx(0,2)
qc.cx(0,3)
qc.cx(0,4)
qc.measure_all()
```

Here we use `optimization_level=3` as it is the best overall.  It is also not noise-aware though, and thus can select lousy qubits on which to do a good SWAP mapping

```python
backend = provider.get_backend('ibm_auckland')
trans_qc = transpile(qc, backend, optimization_level=3)
```

Now, a call to `transpile` inflates the circuit to the number of qubits in the target system.  For small problems like the example here, this prevents us from finding the smaller sub-graphs.  Thus we need to deflate the circuit down to just the number of active qubits:

```python
small_qc = mm.deflate_circuit(trans_qc)
```

We can now find all the matching subgraphs of the target backend onto which the deflated circuit fits:

```python

layouts = mm.matching_layouts(small_qc, backend)
```

returning a list of possible layouts:

```python
[[3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 7],
 [7, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3],
 [1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12],
 [12, 10, 6, 7, 4, 1],
 [3, 5, 9, 8, 11, 14],
 [14, 11, 9, 8, 5, 3],
 [7, 10, 15, 12, 13, 14],
 [7, 10, 13, 12, 15, 18],
 [14, 13, 15, 12, 10, 7],
 [14, 13, 10, 12, 15, 18],
 [18, 15, 13, 12, 10, 7],
 [18, 15, 10, 12, 13, 14],
 [8, 11, 16, 14, 13, 12],
 [8, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19],
 [12, 13, 16, 14, 11, 8],
 [12, 13, 11, 14, 16, 19],
 [19, 16, 13, 14, 11, 8],
 [19, 16, 11, 14, 13, 12],
 [12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23],
 [23, 21, 17, 18, 15, 12],
 [14, 16, 20, 19, 22, 25],
 [25, 22, 20, 19, 16, 14],
 [19, 22, 26, 25, 24, 23],
 [23, 24, 26, 25, 22, 19]]
```

We can then evaluate the "cost" of each layout, by default just the total error rate from gate and readout errors, to find a good candidate:

```python
scores = mm.evaluate_layouts(small_qc, layouts, backend)
```

```python

[([3, 5, 9, 8, 11, 14], 0.1409544035570952),

 ([19, 22, 26, 25, 24, 23], 0.2000625493093675),

 ([12, 13, 11, 14, 16, 19], 0.2879346238104463),
 ([14, 13, 15, 12, 10, 7], 0.3474625243348848),
 ([1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12], 0.34887580284018227),
 ([18, 15, 10, 12, 13, 14], 0.35020374737523874),
 ([7, 10, 15, 12, 13, 14], 0.35023196005467194),
 ([12, 10, 6, 7, 4, 1], 0.3628988750928549),
 ([18, 15, 13, 12, 10, 7], 0.39637978849009425),
 ([14, 13, 10, 12, 15, 18], 0.4063300698900274),
 ([23, 21, 17, 18, 15, 12], 0.41564717799937645),
 ([12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 23], 0.43370673744503807),
 ([7, 10, 13, 12, 15, 18], 0.4472384837396254)]
```

The return layouts and costs are sorted from lowest to highest. You can then use the best layout in a new call to `transpile`
which will then do the desired mapping for you:

```python
best_qc = transpile(small_qc, backend, initial_layout=scores[0][0])
```


Alternatively, it is possible to do the same computation over multiple systems, eg all systems in the provider:

```python
backends = provider.backends()

mm.best_overall_layout(small_qc, backends)
```

that returns a tuple with the target layout, system name, and the computed cost:

```python
([5, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4], 'ibm_hanoi', 0.08603879221106037)
```

Alternatively, we can ask for the best mapping on all systems, yielding a list sorted in order from best to worse:

```python

mm.best_overall_layout(small_qc, backends, successors=True)
```

```python
[([5, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4], 'ibm_hanoi', 0.08603879221106037),
 ([36, 51, 50, 49, 48, 55], 'ibm_washington', 0.09150102196508092),

```

Because of the stochastic nature of the SWAP mapping, the optimal sub-graph may change over repeated compilations.

## Getting optimal results

Because the SWAP mappers in Qiskit are stochastic, the number of inserted SWAP gates can vary with each run.  The spread in this number can be quite large, and can impact the performance of your circuit.  It is thus beneficial to `transpile` many instances of a circuit and take the best one.  For example:

```python
trans_qc_list = transpile([qc]*20, provider.get_backend('ibm_auckland'), optimization_level=3)

best_cx_count = [circ.count_ops()['cx'] for circ in trans_qc_list]
best_cx_count
```

```python
[10, 6, 10, 7, 10, 11, 8, 8, 8, 10, 8, 13, 10, 7, 10, 5, 8, 10, 7, 11]
```

We obviously want the one with minimum CNOT gates here:

```python

best_idx = np.argmin(best_cx_count)
best_qc = trans_qc_list[best_idx]
```

We can then use this best mapped circuit to find the ideal qubit candidates via `mapomatic`.

```python
best_small_qc = mm.deflate_circuit(best_qc)
mm.best_overall_layout(best_small_qc, backends, successors=True)
```

```python
[([3, 2, 4, 1, 0], 'ibm_hanoi', 0.07011500213196731),
 ([51, 50, 48, 49, 55], 'ibm_washington', 0.07499096356285917),

```

## Custom cost functions

You can define a custom cost function in the following manner

```python

def cost_func(circ, layouts, backend):
    """
    A custom cost function that includes T1 and T2 computed during idle periods

    Parameters:
        circ (QuantumCircuit): circuit of interest
        layouts (list of lists): List of specified layouts
        backend (IBMQBackend): An IBM Quantum backend instance

    Returns:
        list: Tuples of layout and cost
    """
    out = []
    props = backend.properties()
    dt = backend.configuration().dt
    num_qubits = backend.configuration().num_qubits
    t1s = [props.qubit_property(qq, 'T1')[0] for qq in range(num_qubits)]
    t2s = [props.qubit_property(qq, 'T2')[0] for qq in range(num_qubits)]
    for layout in layouts:
        sch_circ = transpile(circ, backend, initial_layout=layout,
                             optimization_level=0, scheduling_method='alap')
        error = 0
        fid = 1
        touched = set()
        for item in sch_circ._data:
            if item[0].name == 'cx':
                q0 = sch_circ.find_bit(item[1][0]).index
                q1 = sch_circ.find_bit(item[1][1]).index
                fid *= (1-props.gate_error('cx', [q0, q1]))
                touched.add(q0)
                touched.add(q1)

            elif item[0].name in ['sx', 'x']:
                q0 = sch_circ.find_bit(item[1][0]).index
                fid *= 1-props.gate_error(item[0].name, q0)
                touched.add(q0)

            elif item[0].name == 'measure':
                q0 = sch_circ.find_bit(item[1][0]).index
                fid *= 1-props.readout_error(q0)
                touched.add(q0)

            elif item[0].name == 'delay':
                q0 = sch_circ.find_bit(item[1][0]).index
                # Ignore delays that occur before gates
                # This assumes you are in ground state and errors
                # do not occur.
                if q0 in touched:
                    time = item[0].duration * dt
                    fid *= 1-idle_error(time, t1s[q0], t2s[q0])

        error = 1-fid
        out.append((layout, error))
    return out


def idle_error(time, t1, t2):
    """Compute the approx. idle error from T1 and T2

    t2 = min(t1, t2)
    rate1 = 1/t1

    p_z = (1-p_reset)*(1-np.exp(-time*(rate2-rate1)))/2
    return p_z + p_reset
```

You can then pass this to the layout evaluation steps:

```python

mm.best_overall_layout(small_qc, backends, successors=True, cost_function=cost_func)
```

```python

 ```



## Frequency Collisions
We now want to look at the implementation of frequency collision detection in mapomatic.

First of all, what are frequency collisions?
Frequency collisions are physical effects that can appear, when two nearby qubits have close-enough frequencies (where frequencies mean all possible physical frequencies, e.g. between the 0 and 1 state, 0 and 2 state or 1 and 2 state).
These collisions are unwanted and perturb our system e.g. by altering the states of the qubits. Thus, we would like to avoid these effects when running a circuit.
Fortunately, research has been done on these collisions and in which circumstances they can appear, e.g. in https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00781. This script is based on the results in this paper.
Here, we deal with 7 types of frequency collisions and implement detection and an heuristic approach to avoid them. At this point it is important to state that the functions contained and presented in this library do not garantuee an improved fidelity or complete avoidance of these collisions. It is an heuristic approach based on our best current knowledge of these effects.





## Usage
First, we need to load the modules as well as the account to get access to the backends

```python

from qiskit import *

import mapomatic_fc as mm

import numpy as np

IBMQ.load_account()

provider = IBMQ.get_provider(group="deployed")

```
Next we will choose our backend. The chosen backend will determine the behaviour regarding frequency collisions.
In this example, we will choose ibm_cairo.

```python
backend = provider.get_backend("ibm_cairo")
```

### Getting Frequency Collision Awareness
What we can do first is to look at possible frequency collisions. This can be done using the `collision_dict` function.

```python
collision_dict=mm.detect_fc.collision_dict(backend)
```

The return of this function is a dictionary. The dictionary contains all qubit pairs which are susceptible to a frequency collision of given type.

```python
{1: [],
 2: [[12, 13]],
 3: [],
 4: [[0, 1]],
 5: [[1, 7]],
 6: [[0, 2], [13, 15], [15, 21]],
 7: []}
```

For example, the entry at the key "2" of the dictionary means that the qubits 12 and 13 of this backend are in danger of producing a type 2 frqeuency collisions.

### Choosing the best mapping
While it is already valuable to be aware of possible frequency collisions, we now want to try to avoid them when choosing our mappings.

For this, we first have to run mapomatic. We are using an easy circuit as an example.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0,[1,2])
qc.measure_all()
```
Our example circuit produceds a 3-Qubit GHZ state.
We now apply `mapomatic` to get the best mappings.
```python
trans_qc_list = transpile([qc]*30, backend)
best_cx_count = [circ.count_ops()['cx'] for circ in trans_qc_list]
trans_qc = trans_qc_list[np.argmin(best_cx_count)]


small_circ = mm.deflate_circuit(trans_qc)

layouts = mm.matching_layouts(small_circ, backend)

scores = mm.evaluate_layouts(small_circ, layouts, backend)
```


As stated above, the `evaluate_layouts` function returns an array, ordered according to the score, containing the possible mapping and its mapomatic score.

```python
[([11, 14, 13], 0.03903173087627598),
 ([13, 14, 11], 0.03903173087627598),

We can see that the best mappings according to mapomatic have scores which are very close to each other. Taking into account a finite uncertainty, it is somewhat arbitrary which of those mappings is being chosen; in this sense the scores are degenerate within finite uncertainty.
We can try to (partially) resolve this uncertainty by taking into account frequency collisions: possible frequency collisions can be the cause of very different actual fidelities of these mappings. By trying to avoid mappings with potential frequency collisions, we want to improve the performance of mapomatic.

The first method we present consists of minimizing a score based on the collision dictionary. We minimize it on a subset of (the best) mapomatic mappings.
This is achieved by using the function `best_fc_mapping`. The function takes the return of the `mapomatic.evaluate_layouts`  function (scores) as first argument and the return of `frequency_collision.collision_dict` (collision_dict) as second argument. The third argument specifies what subset of mappings we want to look at. In our case, we choose '0.01' for the third argument.
This means that we look at the list of layouts with the lowest mapomatic score up until layouts with a score of the lowest score+0.01. On this subset, we minimize a second heuristic (which we call here fc_score) based on the collision_dict.

```python
best_layout=mm.detect_fc.best_fc_mapping(scores,collision_dict,0.01)
```
In our case, this returns the mapping

```python
[3,5,8].
```

Additionally, we can introduce weights for each of the frequency collisions. Without weights, all collisions are counted as the same. In practice though, different collisions can have a vastly different impact. Therefore, one could e.g. guess the weight of each collision or run calibration circuits.
The weights should have the form of a dictionary analogous to the collision dictionary. 
As an example, we ran calibration circuits to estimate the impact of each frequency collision. The weight dictionary is then given as

```python
weights_cairo={0: [],
 1: [],
 2: [0.030669479095781882],
 3: [],
 4: [0.1],
 5: [0.06388774996244317],
 6: [0.04813028283408938, 0.06717245767357904, 0.0515341573207877],
 7: []}

```
We can give our `best_fc_mapping` function the weight dictionary as input (keyword argument):

```python
mm.detect_fc.best_fc_mapping(scores,collision_dict,0.01,weight=weights_cairo)
```
This returns again the layout
```python
[3, 5, 8]
```
While it did not make a difference in this example, it is valuable to have the option to give each collision a weight. This might become especially important for larger, more complicated circuits or for very strong and harmful frequency collisions.
We can also slightly change the method by which the score is evaluated. The standard value of the keywordargument of the `best_fc_mapping` function is `method=1`. By changing it to `method=2`, we change to a slightly modified cost function. When using the second method for the cost function
```python
mm.detect_fc.best_fc_mapping(scores,collision_dict,0.01,weight=weights_cairo,method=2)
```
we obtain an alternativy recommendation
```python
[11, 14, 13].
```
A priori it is not clear which of the presented methods is better. But it is useful to know that there are slightly different approaches.

### Cutting out Layouts affected by collisions

The last method we want to look at again tries to avoid collisions. This time though, we do not want to minimize a score but to cut out layouts where the score is too high. So to say, we do not trust our score enough to find us the best mapping but we trust that it tells us when mappings are "too bad".
For this, we can use the `fc_filter` function.
```python
filtered_scores=mm.detect_fc.fc_filter(scores,collision_dict,threshold=1)

```
The function takes an array of the same format as the output of the `mapomatic.evaluate_layouts` function as well as the collision_dictionary.
Furthermore, we have to give the function a threshold at which it cuts out layouts. In our case, we chose the threshold as 1, meaning layouts where the FC score (amount of potential frequency collisions affecting the circuit) is more than 1 are being thrown out.
The return of the function is a subset of the score-array without the layouts whose FC score is too high.
